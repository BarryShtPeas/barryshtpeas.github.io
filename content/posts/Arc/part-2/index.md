## Overview

Getting started with Azure Arc is deceptively easy ‚Äî but getting it right takes forethought. This post breaks down essential pre-requisites and the most common traps that derail successful deployments.

## 1. Network and Connectivity Requirements

Azure Arc requires outbound HTTPS access on port 443 to several Azure endpoints. In restricted environments, this can be a blocker.

- ‚úÖ **Tip:** Allowlist required FQDNs rather than IPs to stay future-proof.
- ‚ùó **Gotcha:** Using a transparent proxy without SSL inspection may break onboarding.

## 2. Identity and Access Management

You‚Äôll need to register the `Microsoft.HybridCompute` and `Microsoft.GuestConfiguration` providers and assign roles correctly.

- ‚úÖ **Best Practice:** Use a dedicated Service Principal for onboarding at scale.
- ‚ùó **Gotcha:** RBAC misconfiguration is a top reason onboarding fails silently.

## 3. OS and Agent Requirements

- Supported OS: Windows Server 2012 R2+, Ubuntu 16.04+, CentOS/RHEL 7+, etc.
- Ensure `Connected Machine Agent` has local admin privileges to install properly.

- ‚úÖ **Best Practice:** Bake the agent into base images for auto-onboarded VMs.
- ‚ùó **Gotcha:** Server core installations often need additional tweaks or dependencies.

## 4. Tagging and Naming Standards

Set naming conventions and tags from the start ‚Äî Arc doesn‚Äôt retro-tag easily.

- Example naming format: `arc-[hostname]-[location]-[env]`
- Use policy to enforce tags on connected machines

## 5. Region Selection and Resource Organization

- Azure Arc resources are metadata-only ‚Äî but they're tied to a region for management.
- Use a dedicated RG per site or environment to simplify governance.

## 6. Gotchas Summary

| Area              | Pitfall                            | Solution                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Networking        | Blocked domains                     | Allowlist required URLs           |
| Identity          | Missing role assignments            | Use scoped Service Principals     |
| OS Support        | Agent fails on unsupported systems  | Check OS compatibility first      |
| Governance        | Inconsistent tags/names             | Apply policies early              |
